# Learn
Explore the Meta Horizon OS capabilities powering rich, shared mixed reality experiences in Cryptic Cabinet: 

- [Scene](https://developers.meta.com/horizon/documentation/unity/unity-scene-overview/): Index and query an up-to-date representation of the physical world. Scene enables Cryptic Cabinet to support rich interactions between users’, virtual objects, and their physical space.  
- [Passthrough](https://developers.meta.com/horizon/documentation/unity/unity-passthrough/): See your physical space in full, rich color. Passthrough API provides a real-time and perceptually comfortable 3D visualization of the physical world in the Meta Quest headsets so users can see and navigate their surroundings.
- [Shared Spatial Anchors](https://developers.meta.com/horizon/documentation/unity/unity-shared-spatial-anchors/): Create local multiplayer experiences for users in the same room. Shared Spatial Anchors enables a shared, world-locked frame of reference for many users playing Cryptic Cabinet together.   
- [Colocation](https://developers.meta.com/horizon/documentation/unity/unity-set-up-colocation-package/): Enable users to jump into the action together in the same physical space. Using Shared Spatial Anchors, colocation supports sharing physical environment information between headsets to enable accurate virtual positioning so players have a consistent, shared perspective of their surroundings. 
- [Interaction SDK](https://developers.meta.com/horizon/documentation/unity/unity-isdk-interaction-sdk-overview/): Power rich, dynamic interactions between users and their virtual environment. This SDK provides a suite of components that support intuitive navigation and interactions like grabbing, poking, teleportation, and more using your controller or hands. In Cryptic Cabinet, these interactions enable players to interact with virtual elements and progress through the escape room.  
- [Passthrough Styling](https://developers.meta.com/horizon/documentation/unity/unity-customize-passthrough-styling/): Add your unique touch to the headset’s visual feed. Color mapping allows you to customize the output color by adjusting contrast, brightness, saturation, and more.

</p>

- [Room Setup](https://github.com/leftfieldlabs/Unity-CrypticCabinet/blob/main/Documentation/FeatureOverview.md#room-setup): Using returned scene primitives via Scene API, a 3D grid of cells is generated to cover the entire room and track where scene objects are placed so they don’t overlap with real world objects. You can preview the scene after cells are generated. 
- [Networking](https://github.com/leftfieldlabs/Unity-CrypticCabinet/blob/main/Documentation/FeatureOverview.md#networking): Using Photon Fusion, Cryptic Cabinet provides the game host with a room code that they can share with other users and enable them to join.
- [Rope](https://github.com/leftfieldlabs/Unity-CrypticCabinet/blob/main/Documentation/FeatureOverview.md#networking): Through Interaction SDK, users can grab the in-game rope at any point along its length using one or two hands, with grabbed positions being synchronized with other users. Realistic collisions are supported to push rope nodes away from each other and from scene objects. 
- [LUT](https://github.com/leftfieldlabs/Unity-CrypticCabinet/blob/main/Documentation/FeatureOverview.md#networking): Using Passthrough Styling, the Passthrough camera feed is darkened when a user activates the game’s UV light or Orrery projection to deliver the effect of being in a dark room. A central manager ensures the effect is replicated for all users.  
- [Camera darkens when inside objects](https://github.com/leftfieldlabs/Unity-CrypticCabinet/blob/main/Documentation/FeatureOverview.md#networking): When a user puts their head inside virtual objects, the camera darkens to replicate a more realistic perspective. Passthrough is disabled and enabled as users look in and out of virtual objects. 
- [Safe Dials](https://github.com/leftfieldlabs/Unity-CrypticCabinet/blob/main/Documentation/FeatureOverview.md#networking): By putting a trigger collider on the index finger of a user’s hand, users can seamlessly swipe the game’s safe dial up and down to crack the safe’s code. 
- [Clock](https://github.com/leftfieldlabs/Unity-CrypticCabinet/blob/main/Documentation/FeatureOverview.md#clock): Through the use of the OneGrabRotateTransformer feature, users can rotate a handle that subsequently rotates the game’s clock hands to detect when the user has selected the correct time, opening the clock door. 
- [Key & UV Bulb](https://github.com/leftfieldlabs/Unity-CrypticCabinet/blob/main/Documentation/FeatureOverview.md#key--uv-bulb): The game’s UV bulb and key combine two interaction modes: The first mode enables users to freely manipulate these objects by grabbing, rotating, and moving them, and the second mode locks the objects in position so they can only be rotated around a single axis.

# Project Structure
The project is organically structured to distinguish the main components of the MR experience's logic. A breakdown of the core features is defined on the [Main Scene](./Assets/CrypticCabinet/Scenes/MainScene.Unity) under the "**CrypticCabinetLogic**" GameObject.

The **CrypticCabinetLogic** contains the following core objects:

- **ColocationManager**, which is responsible for colocating multiple players within the same room, and to keep a single player aligned to the real room throughout the gameplay. For more information, check the documentation inside the **ColocationManager** script.

- **ConnectionManager**, which handles the Photon Fusion connection workflows for single and multiplayer sessions. The PhotonConnector logic showcases how a shared multiplayer session is handled via Photon Fusion, how the creation of shared rooms and lobbies work, and how the connection states can be handled accordingly.

- **PassthroughManager**, which is responsible for the Color LUT effects applied to the passthrough of the supported Quest headsets. During the gameplay, this feature is showcased when interacting with the UV machine puzzle and the light beam hitting the glass globe in the Orrery puzzle. Additional functions are implemented inside the **PassthroughConfigurator** and **PassthroughChanger** as an example of customized effects using Meta's Color LUT APIs from the SDK.

- **SceneManagement**, which holds the logic to use the Scene Understanding API from the SDK to configure the virtual objects placements around the real room of the player, allowing their tweaking when desired.

- **GameManager**, which controls the game phases flow of the gameplay.

- **Player**, which holds the logic for all the interactions a player can perform across the whole experience. This showcases how the Meta Interaction SDK can be used to simplify usability for XR scenarios.

# Gameplay Phases

The [**GameManager**](./Assets/CrypticCabinet/Scripts/GameManagement/GameManager.cs) script controls the game phases of the gameplay. Each game phase is responsible for a specific task of the game:
- **ObjectSpawningGamePhase** handles the scene setup via the scene understanding APIs to tweak the placements for the virtual objects around the room before starting the gameplay;
- **WaitForGuestPhase** waits for Guest players that want to join a multiplayer game before the gameplay starts;
- **Act1TimelinePhase** starts the intro animation of the gameplay;
- **PuzzleLoadingGamePhase** spawns the interactive objects around the room after the intro animation has finished playing;
- **Act3TimelinePhase** starts the outro animation once the gameplay completes and all puzzles are resolved.


# UI System

The main UI for the application is defined through the **UIModalWindow** prefab, which is controlled by the UISystem script.

This script conveniently defines a singleton object that any class in the game can interact with to trigger UI messages and callbacks.
