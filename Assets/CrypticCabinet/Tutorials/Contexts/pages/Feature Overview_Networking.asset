  overrideMarkdownText: "# Networking\r\nMultiplayer is connected and managed via
    <a href=\"https://doc.photonengine.com/realtime/current/getting-started/quick-start\">Photon
    Fusion</a>, given the app is designed for colocation it\u2019s not necessary
    to have a lobby screen. When the host creates a new game they are presented with
    a room code that they then share with their guests. This is handled within <a
    href=\"./Assets/CrypticCabinet/Scripts/Photon/PhotonConnector.cs\">PhotonConnector</a>.
    Also colocation events are triggered from here as well. A deep dive can be found
    <a href=\"https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/unity/unity-colocation-deep-dive/\">here</a>
