    When the user activates the UV light or the
    Orrery projection, the passthrough camera feed is darkened to give the effect
    of being in a dark room, this is achieved using the <a href="https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/unity/unity-customize-passthrough-styling/">Passthrough
    Styling Feature</a> of the  Meta Quest SDK with a <a href="https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/unity/unity-customize-passthrough-color-mapping/#color-look-up-tables-luts">Look
    Up Table</a> (LUT). We use a central manager to control this to ensure consistency
    if both interactions are enabled at the same time. The manager is also used for
    multi-user scenarios to make sure that the effect is replicated for all users
    in the experience.
