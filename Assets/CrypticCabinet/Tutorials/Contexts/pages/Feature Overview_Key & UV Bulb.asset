    ![alt text](../Documentation/Images/UVbulb_unscrew.gif){style=\"width:40%;height:40%\"}\r\n\r\n\r\nBoth
    theUV bulb and the key require two interaction modes combined together.\r\nFirst,
    a mode where they can be freely manipulated, allowing the user to grab, move
    and rotate the objects as normal in the space. Second, a mode where the object
    is locked to a position and can only be rotated around a single axis by the user.\r\nAlthough
    both of these exist in the Meta Quest API in the form of the <a href=\"https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/unity/unity-isdk-grabbable/#one-grab-transformers\">OneGrabFreeTransformer
    and OneGrabRotateTransformer</a>, it is not possible to dynamically switch between
    them after the <a href=\"https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/unity/unity-isdk-grabbable/\">Grabbable</a>
    has been initialized. The solution to this is to create a new script <a href=\"./Assets/CrypticCabinet/Scripts/Interactions/OneGrabToggleRotateTransformer.cs\">OneGrabToggleRotateTransformer</a>
    which combines the functionality of the two aforementioned scripts with additional
    logic to toggle between them at runtime.\r\nFor the use case of the key, once
    it's snapped into the lock, it\u2019s changed to rotation only mode and the rotation
    is tracked until it\u2019s spun anti-clock wise enough to unlock the drawer.\r\nIn
    the case of the bulbs, it\u2019s a little more complex as they need to be snapped
    in place, screwed and/or unscrewed.. This requires toggling between free movement
    and locked rotation when snapped/unsnapped, then raising/lowering the bulb as
    the screwing/unscrewing motion takes place.\r\n\r\n![alt text](../Documentation/Images/Key.gif){style=\"width:50%;height:50%\"}\r\n\r\n\r\n###
